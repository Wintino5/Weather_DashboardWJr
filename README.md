# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

In this project we created a weather dashboard application. We used a combination of HTML, CSS and Javascript to complete the challenge. This assignment allowed us to better our understanding of JQuery, which helped to create a more concise code in JS.
I enjoyed this challenge because I was able to experiment with different CSS styles and customize my dashboard.
